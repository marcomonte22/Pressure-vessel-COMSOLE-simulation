# Resolution of the pressure vessel problem

In this repository we will show the resolution of an important structrual problem in elastostatic. We want to analyze the effects of an internal and external pressure distribution on an hollow cylinder, with an internal radius *a* and an external radius *b*.

The goal is to determine the stress field induced in the material through two different approaches: first, we will show how to achieve a pure algebraic solution, then we will check this solution by simulating the problem in COMSOLE.
