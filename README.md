# Resolution of the pressure vessel problem

In this repository we will show the resolution of an important structrual problem in elastostatic. We want to analyze the effects of an internal and external pressure distribution on an hollow cylinder, with an internal radius *a* and an external radius *b*.

The goal is to determine the stress field induced in the material through two different approaches, numerically and analitically.

## Numerical approach

In order to solve the problem numerically we implemented a structural simulation on COMSOLE using the weak formulation of the elastostatic problem. Here are listed some papers about the mathematical background about the variational calculus, the weak formulation and the finite element method:
* variational calculus
* weak formulation of the elastostatic problem
* finite element method
